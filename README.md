# Redistricting-project-New Mexico

We are utilizing linear programming in our school project to figure out the best configuration for the three congressional districts in New Mexico. For more information on the approaches taken and the suggested solution, see the Project Report. To keep our techniques clear, all utilized files and the code are also given.

The code and numerous additional resources are sourced from the webpage of Dr. Austin Buchanan, which is accessible [here](https://github.com/AustinLBuchanan/Districting-Examples).


The Oklahoma shapefiles are from [Eugene Lykhovyd's website](https://lykhovyd.com/files/public/districting), and the New Mexico county graph is from [Daryl DeFord's](https://lykhovyd.com/files/public/districting). All 50 U.S. states are present on both websites.
